<h1>The Scavenger Cannon -- Now for Garry's Mod 13</h1><br/>
This is the Scavenger Cannon, a multi-purpose, do-everything weapon.  Right click to vacuum up props, left click to shoot them.  Multiple props have firemodes which turn it into things like a rocket launcher, machinegun, grappling hook, and various other weapons and tools. Find them all!

DO NOT repost this on the workshop.  I will release it there when it's completely done and ready for the best experience for everyone.

THE SCAVENGER GAMEMODE IS BROKEN AND A HEAVY WORK IN PROGRESS.  It is currently being ported with the SDM tools to GM13 and will be broken until further notice.
